EM Solvers
==========

**MaxwellLink** ships with three electromagnetic backends. 

- The `Meep <https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ interface runs a full finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) grid and streams polarization sources
  from molecules.

- The single-mode cavity emulator integrates a single harmonic oscillator entirely in atomic units. 

- The laser-driven solver applies a user-defined time-dependent electric field directly to the molecular dipoles with no molecular response back to the field.

Use the pages below for each EM solver.
