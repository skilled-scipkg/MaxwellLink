EM Solvers
==========

MaxwellLink ships with two electromagnetic backends. The Meep interface runs a
full finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) grid and streams polarization sources
from MaxwellLink molecules, while the single-mode cavity emulator integrates a
single harmonic oscillator entirely in atomic units. Use the pages below for each
EM solver.
