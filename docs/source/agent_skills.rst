Agent Skills
============

Agent Skills for **MaxwellLink** provide a simple way to get started with this package. Using natural language prompts, users can easily create input files and run jobs on both local machines and HPC systems. Users can then inspect the input files and modify them as needed for more customized simulations.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature requires cloning the MaxwellLink GitHub repository to access the skills folder. First, either on your local machine or on an HPC cluster, clone the repository and install **MaxwellLink**:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/TaoELi/MaxwellLink.git
   cd MaxwellLink
   pip install .

Then, follow :doc:`installation` to install the third-party EM solver (MEEP FDTD) and molecular drivers.

After installation, you can use MaxwellLink's agent skills to run light-matter simulations automatically.


.. note::

   An agent provider, such as ``codex``, ``claude``, or ``gemini`` [command line interfaces (CLIs), IDE extensions, or desktop applications] needs to be installed and configured in your machine. 


Automated light-matter simulations on local machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please watch the following `walkthrough video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttAvvNByMLg>`_ for an introduction to using MaxwellLink's agent skills with VS Code and the Codex extension:

.. youtube:: ttAvvNByMLg

The aboe video tutorial contains the following steps:

- Open VS Code -> ``File`` -> ``Open Folder...`` -> select ``path/to/MaxwellLink``.
- Install/enable the **Codex** extension (from Marketplace). Make sure the extension has access to the workspace.
- Open the Codex chat panel (usually the side activity bar) and provide your prompt. The agent will load the relevant skills at ``skills/`` and try to accomplish your request.
- When prompted, let the agent run the suggested terminal commands in VS Code's integrated terminal; it will create ``projects/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/`` and create input files for **MaxwellLink**.

The above video tutorial uses the following input prompt:

.. code-block:: text

   In my local machine, run an initially weakly excited two-level system coupled to 2d vacuum using meep fdtd and plot the excited-state population dynamics


Automated light-matter simulations on Anvil HPC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using `Purdue Anvil HPC system <https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/knowledge/anvil>`_ (available via the `NSF ACCESS program <https://www.access-ci.org/>`_) as an example, we can also run MaxwellLink light-matter simulations.

Please watch the following `demo video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0PVxcvriDM>`_ for an introduction to using MaxwellLink's agent skills on HPC systems:

Different from the local machine setup, we need to **configure VS Code to connect to the remote HPC** system via SSH. Please refer to the official VS Code documentation for detailed instructions on setting up SSH connections:

`https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh>`_

After setting up the SSH connection, follow these steps:

- Open VS Code -> ``File`` -> ``Open Folder...`` -> select ``path/to/MaxwellLink`` on the remote HPC system.
- Install/enable the **Codex** extension (from Marketplace). Make sure the extension has access to the workspace.
- Open the Codex chat panel (usually the side activity bar), switch mode to **Agent (full access)** (bottom panel setting). This will allow to run commands without approval for each command.
- Provide your prompt. The agent will load the relevant skills at ``skills/`` and try to accomplish your request.
- When prompted, let the agent run the suggested terminal commands in VS Code's integrated terminal; it will create ``projects/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/`` and create input files for **MaxwellLink**.

The above video tutorial uses the following input prompt:

.. code-block:: text

   In this Anvil HPC system, run a slurm job of an initially weakly excited two-level system coupled to 2d vacuum using meep fdtd and then plot the excited-state population dynamics after the slurm job


Customizing HPC settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can modify the HPC settings in the ``skills/mxl-hpc-slurm/resources/hpc_setting.md`` file to match their HPC system requirements. The default configuration is set up for the Anvil HPC system. Users can change parameters accordingly for different HPC systems.
