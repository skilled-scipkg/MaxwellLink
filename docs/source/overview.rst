**MaxwellLink** provides a flexible and general platform for self-consistent light-matter simulations. It
couples various electromagnetics (EM) solvers, such as finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) approach, with
a hierarchy of quantum and molecular dynamics packages. The light and matter solvers can run either
within the same process or in separate computing nodes communicating through a TCP/Unix socket interface, 
thus enabling productive light-matter simulations at different scales and levels of theory.

Use this documentation to install the **MaxwellLink** package, run your first self-consistent light-matter simulation, and
explore the available EM solvers and molecular drivers. For developers, the :doc:`architecture` and :doc:`contributing` sections provide an 
overview of the code structure, design principles, and how to extend the framework with custom solvers.
