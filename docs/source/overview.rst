MaxwellLink Documentation
======================================

MaxwellLink couples various electromagnetics (EM) solvers, such as finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) approach, with
quantum and molecular dynamics packages through a lightweight socket interface, enabling the simulation of self-consistent
light-matter interactions across multiple scales.
