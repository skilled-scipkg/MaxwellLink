Introduction
============

**MaxwellLink** provides a flexible software bridge between electromagnetic (EM) solvers, 
such as finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) approach, and quantum or classical molecular dynamics
engines. The toolkit originated in the `TEL Research Group <https://www.taoeli.org>`_ at
University of Delaware and is designed for self-consistent light-matter simulations in which both the EM and
molecular subsystems evolve using state-of-the-art computational methods. 

**MaxwellLink** can be used for both demonstration and production purposes. With a single laptop, we can use **MaxwellLink**
to prototype light-matter dynamics involving model systems or first-principles quantum dynamics. On
high-performance computing clusters, **MaxwellLink** can couple a parallel FDTD solver with hundreds of molecular drivers
running across networked nodes using a TCP socket interface.

Key capabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Simplified and **unified Python API** for self-consistent light-matter simulations.
- Couple an EM solver (such as Meep FDTD or a single-mode cavity) to one or many molecular
  drivers running in the same process or across networked nodes via **TCP sockets**.
- Mix **heterogeneous molecular theories** within a single EM simulation, spanning
  simple two-level systems (TLSs) and QuTiP model Hamiltonians, to Psi4-based
  RT-TDDFT/Ehrenfest dynamics, and ASE- or LAMMPS-powered molecular mechanics.
- Tolerate driver pauses or restarts — the ``SocketHub`` automatically waits for
  reconnections before resuming a simulation step.
- Operate under **MPI**: only the master rank in the EM simulation speaks to the drivers 
  while field data and molecular response are broadcast to worker ranks.
- **Flexible to extend**: users can implement custom molecular drivers or EM solvers
  by writing a few wrapper functions; see :doc:`contributing` for details.

Included EM solvers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Meep FDTD** – a popular (industry-standard) open-source FDTD package with a user-friendly 
  Python interface maintained by `MIT <https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
- **Single-mode cavity** – a simple 1D cavity mode solver with support for
  damping and external driving fields, useful for rapid prototyping and debugging
  of simplified quantum optics and polaritonics models.
- **Laser driven dynamics** – a driver that applies arbitrary user-defined classical electric fields
  without back-action from the molecular system, useful for pump-probe and strong-field simulations.

Included molecular drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Model systems** – a lightweight TLS driver and a `QuTiP <https://qutip.org>`_ interface for custom
  Hamiltonians with optional Lindblad terms.
- **First-principles nonadiabatic quantum dynamics** – RT-TDDFT and
  RT-TDDFT-Ehrenfest drivers implemented using `Psi4 <https://psicode.org/>`_ integrals.
- **Classical or first-principles molecular mechanics** – ASE drivers that wrap any
  `ASE <https://ase-lib.org/index.html>`_ calculator (including `Psi4 <https://psicode.org/>`_,
  `ORCA <https://www.faccts.de/orca/>`_, `DFTB+ <https://www.dftbplus.org/>`_) and a `LAMMPS <https://www.lammps.org/>`_ plugin using
  ``fix mxl``.
