Introduction
============

MaxwellLink provides a flexible software bridge between electromagnetic (EM) solvers, 
such as finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) approach, and quantum or classical molecular dynamics
engines. The toolkit originated in the `TEL Research Group <https://www.taoeli.org>`_ at
University of Delaware and is designed for self-consistent light-matter simulations in which both the EM and
molecular subsystems evolve using state-of-the-art computational methods. 

MaxwellLink can be used for both demonstration and production purposes. With a single laptop, we can use MaxwellLink
to prototype light-matter dynamics involving model systems or first-principles quantum dynamics. On
high-performance computing clusters, MaxwellLink can couple a parallel FDTD solver with hundreds of molecular drivers
running across networked nodes using a TCP socket interface.

Key capabilities
----------------

- Simplified and **unified Python API** for self-consistent light-matter simulations.
- Couple an EM solver (currently Meep FDTD or a single-mode cavity) to one or many molecular
  drivers running in the same process or across networked nodes via **TCP sockets**.
- Mix **heterogeneous molecular theories** within a single EM simulation, ranging from
  two-level systems (TLSs), QuTiP model Hamiltonians, to Psi4-based RT-TDDFT,
  Ehrenfest dynamics, and ASE- and LAMMPS-powered molecular mechanics.
- Tolerate driver pauses or restarts—the ``SocketHub`` automatically waits for
  reconnections before resuming a simulation step.
- Operate under MPI: only the master rank in the EM simulation speaks to the drivers 
  while field data and molecular response are broadcast to worker ranks.
- **Flexible to extend**: users can implement custom molecular drivers or EM solvers
by writing a few wrapper functions.

Included EM solvers
------------------------

- **Meep FDTD** – a popular open-source FDTD package with Python bindings
  maintained by `MIT <https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
- **Single-mode cavity** – a simple 1D cavity mode solver with support for
  damping and external driving fields, useful for prototyping, debugging, and 
  simplified quantum optics and polaritonics calculations.

Included driver families
------------------------

- **Model systems** – a lightweight TLS driver and a QuTiP interface for custom
  Hamiltonians with optional Lindblad terms.
- **First-principles nonadiabatic quantum dynamics** – RT-TDDFT and
  RT-TDDFT-Ehrenfest drivers implemented using Psi4 capable of sub-stepping when the electronic time
  step is shorter than the FDTD step.
- **Classical or first-principles molecular mechanics** – ASE drivers that wrap any
  ASE calculator (including Psi4, ORCA, DFTB+) and a LAMMPS plugin using
  ``fix mxl``.
