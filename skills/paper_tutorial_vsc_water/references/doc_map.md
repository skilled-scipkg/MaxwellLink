# Doc Map: paper_tutorial_vsc_water

## Scope
- Reproduction track: vibrational strong coupling workflows in single-mode and Meep-Bragg configurations.
- Figure ids covered: `fig_001`, `fig_002`, `fig_003`.
- Runtime convention: run simulations and calculations in `projects/YYYY-MM-DD-<scope>/` (recommended scope slug here: `vsc-water`).

## Playbook Index
- `fig_001` (single-mode cavity spectra and coupling-size scaling): `skills/paper_tutorial_vsc_water/playbooks/fig_001_singlemode_vsc.md`
- `fig_002` (Meep Bragg resonator spectra and transmission context): `skills/paper_tutorial_vsc_water/playbooks/fig_002_meep_bragg_vsc.md`
- `fig_003` (stepping-time scaling versus cores): `skills/paper_tutorial_vsc_water/playbooks/fig_003_scaling.md`
