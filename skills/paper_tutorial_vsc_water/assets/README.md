# Paper Tutorial Assets

This assets bundle contains only lightweight, manifest-backed reproducibility files for the VSC figure family:
- simulation templates and Slurm launch scripts
- LAMMPS input templates
- plotting/postprocess scripts
- small Bragg reference text files

Large raw trajectory/result bundles (for example full `.npz` production outputs) are intentionally excluded.

Use these assets by copying `assets/implementation_2025/` into `projects/YYYY-MM-DD-<scope>/` (recommended scope here: `vsc-water`).
