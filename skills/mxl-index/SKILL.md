# MaxwellLink skill index

## Route the request
- Classify the request as: input preparation, solver/driver selection, run execution, HPC deployment, post-processing, or troubleshooting.
- Load the corresponding specialized skill below and follow its checklist end-to-end.

## Choose solver/driver quickly
- Use `skills/mxl-core/references/solver_quickref.md` to pick an EM solver.
- Use `skills/mxl-core/references/driver_quickref.md` to pick a molecular driver.
- Confirm coupling mode:
  - Use embedded drivers when everything can run inside the EM process.
  - Use sockets when drivers must run as separate processes or nodes.
